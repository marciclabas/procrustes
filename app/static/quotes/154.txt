I recently had a meal in a fancy restaurant with complicated dishes with fancy names ($125 per person), then enjoyed a pizza afterward, straight out of the oven, $7.95. I wonder why the pizza isn't twenty times the price of the complicated dish, since I'd rather have the former—at any price—over the latter.
