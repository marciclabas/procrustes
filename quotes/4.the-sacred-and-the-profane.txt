You cannot express the holy in terms made for the profane, but you can discuss the profane in terms made for the holy
Atheism (materialism) means treating the dead as if they were unborn. I won't. By accepting the sacred, you reinvent religion.
Paganism is decentralized theology.
If you can't spontaneously detect (without analyzing) the difference between sacred and profane, you'll never know what religion means. You will also never figure out what we commonly call art. You will never understand anything.
People used to wear ordinary clothes weekdays and formal attire on Sunday. Today it is the exact reverse.
To mark a separation between holy and profane, I take a ritual bath after any contact, or correspondence (even emails), with consultants, economists, Harvard Business School professors, journalists, and those in similarly depraved pursuits; I then feel and act purified from the profane until the next episode.
Religion isn't so much about telling man that there is one God as about preventing man from thinking that he is God.
The fewer the gods, the greater the dogma and theological intolerance. So n = 0 ("modern" atheists), n = 1 (Sunni purists), n = 1–2 (Monophysites), n = 3–12 (Greek Orthodoxy), n flex (Ancient Mediterranean Paganism).
The book is the only medium left that hasn't been corrupted by the profane: everything else on your eyelids manipulates you with an ad.
You can replace lies with truth; but myth is only displaced with a narrative.
The sacred is all about unconditionals; the profane is all about conditionals.
The ancient Mediterranean: before monotheism, people changed and exchanged rites and gods as we do ethnic foods.
The source of the tragic in history is in mistaking someone else's unconditional for conditional—and the reverse.
Atheists are just modern versions of religious fundamentalists: both take religion too literally.
Restaurants get you in with food to sell you liquor; religions get you in with belief to sell you rules (e.g., avoid debt). People can understand the notion of God, not unexplained rules, interdicts, and categorical heuristics.
One categorical: it is easier to fast than diet. You cannot be "slightly" kosher or halal by only eating a small portion of ham.
To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week's newspapers.
