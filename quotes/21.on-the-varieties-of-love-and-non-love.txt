At any stage, humans can thirst for money, knowledge, or love; sometimes for two, never for three.
Love without sacrifice is like theft.
You may eventually forgive and befriend someone who harmed you, never someone who bored you.
Marriage is the institutional process of feminizing men—and feminizing women.
What counts is not what people say about you, it is how much energy they spend in saying it.
There are men who surround themselves with women (and seek wealth) for ostentation; others who do so mostly for consumption; they are rarely the same.
The ones who refer to you repeatedly as “my friend” are most likely to betray you.
Outside of friendship and love, it is very hard to find situations with bilateral, two-way suckers.
An enemy who becomes a friend will stay a friend; a friend turned enemy will never become one.
I attended a symposium, an event named after a fifth-century (B.C.) Athenian drinking party in which nonnerds talked about love; alas, there was no drinking and, mercifully, nobody talked about love.
Journalists feel contempt for those who fear them and a deep resentment for those who don’t.
You will get the most attention from those who hate you. No friend, no admirer, and no partner will flatter you with as much curiosity.
Used skillfully, a compliment will be much more offensive than any disparagement.
Humans need to complain just as they need to breathe. Never stop them; just manipulate them by controlling what they complain about and supply them with reasons to complain. They will complain but be thankful.
When a young woman partners with an otherwise uninteresting rich man, she can sincerely believe that she is attracted to some very specific body part (say, his nose, neck, or knee).
Injuries done to us by others tend to be acute; the self-inflicted ones tend to be chronic.
When people call you intelligent it is almost always because they agree with you. Otherwise they just call you arrogant.
A good foe is far more loyal, far more predictable, and, to the clever, far more useful than the most valuable admirer.
We often benefit from harm done to us by others, almost never from self inflicted injuries.
If my detractors knew me better they would hate me even more.
