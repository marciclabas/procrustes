To understand how something works, figure out how to break it.
You are only secure if you can lose your fortune without the additional worse insult of having to become humble.
To test someone's robustness to reputational errors, ask a man in front of an audience if he is "still doing poorly" or if he is "still losing money" and watch his reaction.
General principle: the solutions (on balance) need to be simpler than the problems.
The trick in life (and risk management) is to have as much respect for experience before one acquires said experience as one would after.
Robustness is progress without impatience.
When conflicted between two choices, take neither.
Nation-states like war; city-states like commerce; families like stability; and individuals like entertainment.
The problem with the idea of "learning from one's mistakes" is that most of what people call mistakes aren't mistakes.
Robust is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who dislike it (artists); fragile when you care more about the few who dislike your work than the multitude who like it (politicians).
The rationalist imagines an imbecile-free society; the empiricist an imbecile-proof one, or, even better, a rationalist-proof one.
Failure-resistant is achievable; failure-free is not.
Academics are only useful when they try to be useless (say, as in mathematics and philosophy) and dangerous when they try to be useful.
For the robust, an error is information; for the fragile, an error is an error.
The best test of robustness to reputational damage is your emotional state (fear, joy, boredom) when you get an email from a journalist.
The main disadvantage of being a writer, particularly in Britain, is that there is nothing you can do in public or private that would damage your reputation.
The only valid political system is one that can handle an imbecile in power without suffering from it.
Passionate hate (by nations and individuals) ends by rotation to another subject of hate; mediocrity cannot handle more than one enemy. This makes warring statelings with shifting alliances and enmities a robust system.
You can expect blowups and explosive errors in fields where there is a penalty for simplicity.
I find it inconsistent (and corrupt) to dislike big government while favoring big business—but (alas) not the reverse.
Increasingly, people don't become academics because of intelligence, but rather because of a lower grasp of disorder.
How often have you arrived one, three, or six hours late on a transatlantic flight as opposed to one, three, or six hours early? This explains why deficits tend to be larger, rarely smaller, than planned.
For a free person, the optimal—most opportunistic—route between two points should never be the shortest one.
