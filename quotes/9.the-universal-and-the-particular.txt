What I learned on my own I still remember.
Regular minds find similarities in stories (and situations); finer minds detect differences.
To grasp the difference between Universal and Particular, consider that some dress better to impress a single, specific person than an entire crowd.
We unwittingly amplify commonalities with friends, dissimilarities with strangers, and contrasts with enemies.
Many are so unoriginal they study history to find mistakes to repeat.
There is nothing deemed harmful (in general) that cannot be beneficial in some particular instances, and nothing deemed beneficial that cannot harm you in some circumstances. The more complex the system, the weaker the notion of Universal.
The fool generalizes the particular; the nerd particularizes the general; some do both; and the wise does neither.
You want to be yourself, idiosyncratic; the collective (school, rules, jobs, technology) wants you generic to the point of castration.
True love is the complete victory of the particular over the general, and the unconditional over the conditional.
For an honest person, freedom requires having no friends; and, one step above, sainthood requires having no family.
