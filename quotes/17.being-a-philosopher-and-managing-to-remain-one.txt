To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.
Real mathematicians understand completeness, real philosophers understand incompleteness, the rest don't formally understand anything.
In twenty-five centuries, no human came along with the brilliance, depth, elegance, wit, and imagination to match Plato—to protect us from his legacy.
A philosopher uses logic without statistics, an economist uses statistics without logic, a physicist uses both.
Why do I have an obsessive Plato problem? Most people need to surpass their predecessors; Plato managed to surpass all his successors.
It is perplexing but amusing to observe people getting extremely excited about things you don't care about; it is sinister to watch them ignore things you believe are fundamental.
To be a philosopher is to know through long walks, by reasoning, and reasoning only, a priori, what others can only potentially learn from their mistakes, crises, accidents, and bankruptcies—that is, a posteriori.
Engineers can compute but not define, mathematicians can define but not compute, economists can neither define nor compute.
Something finite but with unknown upper bounds is epistemically equivalent to something infinite. This is epistemic infinity.
Mathematics demands an uncontrolled hunger for abstraction, philosophy a very controlled one.
Conscious ignorance, if you can practice it, expands your world; it can make things infinite.
For the classics, philosophical insight was the product of a life of leisure; for us, a life of leisure can be the product of philosophical insight.
For many people, it takes a lot of preparation to learn to become ordinary.
It takes a lot of intellect and confidence to accept that what makes sense doesn't really make sense.
A theological Procrustean bed: for the Orthodox since Gregory Palamas and for the Arabs since Algazel, attempts to define God using the language of philosophical universals were a rationalistic mistake. I am still waiting for a modern to take notice.
Let us find what risks we can measure and these are the risks we should be taking.
Saying "the mathematics of uncertainty" is like saying "the chastity of sex"—what is mathematized is no longer uncertain, and vice versa.
If your approach to mathematics is mechanical not mystical, you're not going to go anywhere.
Sadly, we learn the most from fools, economists, and other reverse role models, yet we pay them back with the worst ingratitude.
Salaried people are just stepparents. They can be good stepparents but never match the biological.
In Plato's Protagoras, Socrates contrasts philosophy as the collaborative search for truth with the sophist's use of rhetoric to gain the upper hand in argument for fame and money. Twenty-five centuries later, this is exactly the salaried researcher and the modern tenure-loving academic. Progress.
